Clone of the popular Todoist list application (https://todoist.com) from scratch using React (Custom Hooks, Context), Firebase & React Testing Library (unit & integration testing). In addition to the latter technologies, we will be styling the application using SCSS (CSS) and following the BEM naming methodology. I will also be making sure that this application is fully responsive
